# State Management in Flutter

This is an example of how state management is done in a very simple todo app.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/farrelmahaztra/flutter-todo.git
```

2. Move into the directory

```
cd flutter-todo
```

3. Run the app, this should automatically install dependencies and run in Chrome

```
flutter run
```

## Notes

- This isn't the best or only example of how to do state management, there's plenty to improve! :)
- Things to think about:
  - What else can we add, and how can we try and manage the new state (if any)?
    - Examples: validating the todo form, updating an individual todo, categorizing todos
  - How can we reduce code duplication?
  - How can we optimize the state management here to limit unnecessary rebuilds?
  - How else can we structure the app directory? Is the naming of the widgets idiomatic?
